note left of User
    **Primary Actor:** The User is the primary actor
    who interacts with the system to manage personal
    finances, set budgets, view analytics, and receive
    notifications when budget thresholds are exceeded.
end note

note bottom of BankingSystem
    **Secondary Actor (External System):** The External
    Banking System provides transaction data to the
    application during import. It represents the outside
    banking platform that the system communicates with
    to retrieve financial records securely.
end note

note bottom of NotificationService
    **Secondary Actor (External System):** The Notification
    Service delivers alert messages to users when budget
    conditions are triggered. It represents external
    messaging capabilities such as email, SMS, or push
    notification services.
end note

' ============================================================

note top of UC_Dashboard
    **View Analytics Dashboard:** Displays visual charts,
    spending breakdowns, and trends based on categorized
    transactions. Users can analyze financial habits and
    make informed decisions from this view.
end note

note top of UC_Categorize
    **Categorize Expenses:** Assigns transactions into
    spending categories using rules, AI classification,
    or manual input. Proper categorization supports
    budgeting, alerts, and dashboard analytics.
end note

note left of UC_Import
    **Import Transactions:** Enables the user to bring
    transaction records from the External Banking System.
    Once imported, transactions are automatically sent
    for categorization to organize spending data.
end note

note right of UC_Auth
    **Authenticate User:** Verifies user identity through
    secure login credentials. This reusable use case
    establishes a valid session and is included by
    other use cases requiring identity verification.
end note

note left of UC_Accounts
    **Manage Accounts:** Allows the user to add, edit,
    and remove financial accounts in the system. This
    use case includes authentication to ensure only
    authorized users can access account information.
end note

note right of UC_Alerts
    **Receive Budget Alerts:** Triggered when spending
    crosses user-defined thresholds. The system generates
    alerts delivered via the Notification Service to
    inform users of budget status in real-time.
end note

note left of UC_Budget
    **Set Budget Thresholds:** Allows users to define
    spending limits for categories or overall budgets.
    These thresholds determine when the system triggers
    alert notifications to warn users.
end note
